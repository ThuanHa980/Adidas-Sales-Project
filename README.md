# Adidas-Sales-Project

## Overview

This project show the sales dashboard of Adidas sales from 2020 to 2021. From the dashboard we learn that there are an obvious increased in sales from 2020 to 2021, this appears since we now know about the Covid pandemic that occured. For future project, I want to improve this dashboard by showing at least two previous years before and after 2020. This will show a much bigger picture of how the Covid pandemic affects economic of companies.
