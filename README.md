# Adidas-Sales-Project

## Overview

This project show the sales dashboard of Adidas sales in the US from 2020 to 2021. In this dashboard there are filters features that will let user select the location, retailers, and products of Adidas store. From the dashboard we learn that there are an obvious increased in sales from 2020 to 2021, this we now know was cause by the Covid pandemic, as there are less people shopping and many peoples that are out of work at the time would also spend less. For future project, I want to improve this dashboard by showing at least two previous years before and after 2020. This will show a much bigger picture of how the Covid pandemic affects economic of companies.
